# blogthing

This idea is essentially from the following workflow:

- Write a markdown file
- SCP/FTP/POST file to a self-hosted lab machine
- machine now serves that new markdown file

This is partially as a lazy out for myself on my own website,
as well as for others hoping to do the same thing.
HTML syntax can be cumbersome and unintuitive, at least to my modern brain,
so having a dynamic and easy way of simply serving "markdown"
disguised as HTML is ideal if I actually want to put any writing out there.

## Usage

`-h` flag gives commandline options and flags.
Really all you need to do is specify a listening port,
any optional style sheets, etc,
and expose this webserver to the internet.

## Contributions/Future plans

This project is much more casual than my others.
If a request comes in and seems reasonable, I am likely to merge it, or develop it.
Otherwise, most of this codebase will be for my own purposes.
